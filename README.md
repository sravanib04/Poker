# Poker

## What it does
This is a two player Poker game created using Java. The objective of this game is to get the best hand for each round. 

## How I built it
With the use of four different classes (Game, Card, Hand, and Deck) I utilized the concept of inheritance (subclasses also known as child classes can use the methods from the main class also known as the parent class) to build a Poker game in Java for people to play.

## What I learned
I realized the importance of subclasses. I cannot make every line of code in one class. I also realized that parent classes, Card and Deck, have general methods that are not specific to just the game Poker, but might be helpful in other card games such as Black Jack as well.
